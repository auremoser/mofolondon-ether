Leaders to Leaders Conversations

Convening

Problems:
Following up on projects from MozFest, making the ones from previous years findable/updatable
Need comm channels that allow all types of people to participate (introverts, extroverts)

Opportunities for convening: 
Input of proposals
Navigation of event itself
	* people don’t always have mobile devices
Connection between people
Documentation of projects/ stories
Follow up on community response to project after an event would be useful (i.e. science sprint)

Facilitators ask how they can share their sessions

Insights team

Goal: align on why and how we want to collect/share stories and projects across Mofo

Why:
	* Bring heart to issues
	* communications: feature story > press releases
	* shared experience to bring people into movement
	* we have stories/content already, we need to use them to inform the issues
	* stories give characters to projects

Current initiatives
	Gigabit community fund (interviews and posts)
		Audience: Mozilla network funders
	Medium publication/publishing platform
		Audience: general consumers, everyday users
		
Looking to output in 3 ways:
    State of the web publication
		* Health of the web" around the issues we care about
			* Metrics and visualization
			* Human story & narrative
		* Audience: Organizations and conscious consumers, like Firefox users
    Issues Radar ("What is Mozilla doing on x?")
    Mozilla.org Publishing platform ("Mozilla Medium")
    
Pulse of the network
	* Network story collection & visualization
	* Mozfest proposals
	* Fellowship applications

Research
	* 600 stories & Multi-media
	* several countries
	* local use/patterns
	* passions, interests

Science
Interviews
posts
onboarding

Challenges:
	* Member contributions
	* Navigate/search/find things that are going on around Mozilla
	* Demonstrating impact

Steps needed
	1. Intake- items focused on one of 5 issues
	1. Triage/analysis
	* visualize
	* Coding/research
	* Interviews
	* (Thank submitter)
	1. Output
	* Communications/marketing

Leaders to Leaders:

Event App Upgrades:
Improve what we already have:
	* Improve UX
		* users view of now, next, and favorites
		* Preserve app state across session
		* Offline functionality
		* Reduce scrolling (on mobile especially)
	* Explore options for syncing between devices (ex. desktop to mobile)
	* Feedback from staff on London use of pads
	* Improve admin experience of session management
	* Evaluate benefits of Reactication? (Improves scalability)
	* Identify diverse use-cases across org (ex science sprint, maker party, ...)
Add new features:
	* Add stream (etherpad-esque images, text and links)
		* Think about data management (researching) - Spreadsheet vs database (cms)
	* Prototype beacon possibilities
	* Does the schedule app need to facilitate post-session connections between leaders?
	* meet with program managers for user feedback and interviews
	* apply mofo universal design style to app

Pulse project:
	Our Problem: We don't have a comprehensive view of artifacts created by network members. We struggle to judge our impact, and leverage that knowledge to tell our story and improve our programs. We don’t have an effective way to share it with people, on social networks, with our institutional allies, and individual partners. (People within the org don't know what successes we've had (related to our issues agenda), even harder for outsiders to find out)
	Opportunity: An ongoing view of network artifacts enables us to elevate the best work of our members, a valuable incentive for participation. When we build a better practice to surface and amplify these artifacts, we can also better understand and demonstrate the value that the network provides to each node in the network. (A way to surface and amplify content (improve discoverability) from across Mozilla, in one spot. These are stories/blog posts/successes/??? about the five main agenda issues)
	* Familiarize ourselves with the project and problem space more
	* Figure out how we encourage people to submit entries - (demo calls, regular emails, mozbot nagging, scrub our blogs, pinterest style plugin ... )
	* Figure out how it reaches people (site, email, notifications, RSS, Mozbot, carrier pigeon?)
	* Define the requirements for the process and/or system
	* Explore how to create a story telling culture at Mozilla (interview people...)
	* No implementing yet.
	* Be mindful of these needs as we build other projects (consider APIs)
	* Add small features like tags, deep linking, from event reporter to pulse for testing at Mozfest
	* meet with program managers for user feedback and interviews
	* kiosk at mozfest for people to add stories



Science's Collaborative Projects/Hive Stories(portfolio)
	* Problem: collect & share projects from all the hubs, in order to help connect leaders.
	* Phase II science site - github integration to finish "projects"

Chat
	* Problem: Provide a real-time, persistent communication channel for Mozillians and Leaders to connect and collaborate effectively.
	* Gather user feedback
		* People who are using it- what works/doesn't work
		* People who aren't: why?
	* Evaluate and implement integrations that the team might find useful
	* Improve onboarding experience

SUGGESTIONS

NOTES
Kaitlin : What is the science lab? How did the WOW become a thing?
  3 years of existance, reach community, become engaged
  1 year ago: how to better serve communities?
	* Computational Training? Went to community, what can Mozilla do?
	*  Mozilla's role was to provide momentum and to provide a platform, led to WOW and wow guide
  September last year: Workshop in Toronto on creating a Working open Workshop
  1st WOW: Berlin
	* 30 members of community
	*  dig into things like creating README, roadmap, understanding on how to get started, how to get started 
Today:
	* Go through the materials that were created to support your own WOW

Zannah: Instructional Designer, Curriculum development
	* Created curriculum for workshop, worked with participants on designing things for their own projects
	* create  READMEs, contributing guidelines, persona
	* WOW: day of
		* presentations, work directly with participants

Abby:

Exploring Internet Enable Devices for Learning (Robert/Julia)
Room 11 / Metropole Tower Wing
Wednesday, 2:45 PM

Step 1
	* Download Arduino IDE application (Google it)
Step 2
	* Go to http://hackshop.org
	* Click level 5
	* Start with challenge 5.3

Device
	* Arduino - https://www.arduino.cc/
	* The Photon www.spark.io/start
	* Makey Makey (as entry point and for younger audiences) 
	* 
Device Tips
	* 
	* 
	* 
Online Resources
	* Official: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage
	* SparkFun is awesome, and their Ed director believes in an "open hardware" approach: https://learn.sparkfun.com/
		* Project ideas, tutorials, etc. - compatible with Arduino
	* Wireless Earth Watchdogs blog: http://wirelessearthwatchdawgs.blogspot.co.uk/
		* Hive CHA project, using environmental sensors in a classroom setting - project blog, with code, videos, lessons, etc.
	* In Comic Sans, but plenty of resources/tutorials via https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/ 
	* Adaptable/for younger students - LittleBits are less hackable, but the project themes/ideas in concert with other sensors/etc. may be useful/inspirational: http://littlebits.cc/lessons?type=lesson&sort=recent&page=1&per_page=12#browse
	* Via Make Magazine, Arduino projects: http://makezine.com/category/technology/arduino/
	* Arduino on Git: https://github.com/arduino/
	* How to build your own Arduino board: http://diyhacking.com/make-arduino-board-and-bootload/
	* Flocky Bird (built by Michelle) - https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/flockybird - great for Makey Makey, also uses Thimble to allow people to adjust code to change elements of the game 


Project Ideas
	* LED Thermometer+1
		* Write a program that reads tomorrow's weather forecast
		* Send output from that program to an LED thermometer that glows according to the temperature forecast
		* Advanced: if you can capture physical input (e.g. via a Makey Makey) you could build a touch-sensitive map that allow you to touch the location where you're traveling tomorrow and program the LED to light based on the forecast temperature in that location.
	* Sound Thermometer
		* https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial.WiFi101WeatherAudioNotifier

Open Lead
Deep Dive: Module 1 - Intro to Open Leadership

Feedback:
	* Exercises throughout are really helpful (Andre)
	* Time estimates are outstanding (from an educator's perspective, especially) (Geoff M)
	* Open Canvas- like approaches have been useful for startups / sussing out ideas for project pitches (which is another exercise!) (Geoff M)
	* Styling for low-bandwith? 
	* 


Questions:
	* Geographically local projects / hyper local - what is the eventual platform for the sharing of the projects themselves (to get more global attention)? 
		* Z: this is a tool for anyone starting a project anywhere.  not the purview necessarily of this training to create the platform, but there are conversations about how to support that sort of sharing MLN wide (current example, Science Lab's "Projects" page : https://science.mozilla.org/projects
	* What about lo-fi / low connectivity communities? 
		* Z: right now this is primarily a content draft. next bit of work is to dig into delivery mechanism. 
		* C: part of this work in extending across hubs and communities is working with them to help implement and adapt. 
			* the github sessions are there due to a need across many of the communities, but by no means a requirement for low fi communities. 

========


Deep Dive: Module 2 - Open Communications

Feedback:
	*  like the chat channels for projects (a lot of projects have them, and helpful) (abby)
	*  would love to see more references / links to groups that are providing help (ie., need help with web development? click here!) (andre)
	* love learning by examples (andre)
	* like at the very least consider 2 types of comms - it's achievable. might be able to even broaden that (consider a communication channel that's outside of your comfort zone but keep it achievable)
	*  love the video, but does seem quite involved. wonder if for a much smaller project, an example of a smaller project would help too
	* Reps innovation fund - tiny accelerator for Reps based projects (grants of $100). what they're missing are trainings like this. how can we get to all those interested. 
	* 

Questions:

	* question about github - users don't necessarily use github. how to accomodate for that - should we be encouraging it?
		* C: we do see github heavily used in the community. are a bit opinionated by that, by design. also for folks a bit further along
	* have you thought about this for an RFP process? have talked to a lot of educators who have great ideas but need help planning. could be really useful. 
	* recognition for those who complete this? 
		* badging? 
		* certificate for credentialing
			* open to suggestions! 
	* strategy for localisation 
	* what is the measure of impact?

The Future of MozFest: What will MozFest look like in 2020? 
*******************************************************************************

Discussion 1: London All-Hands, June 2016

Attendees: Mark, Chris, Sarah, Erika, Angela

Meeting format: Discuss 3 broad questions to inform how MozFest should evolve, be relevant to our strategy, and valuable to our community.


	1) What is the purpose of MozFest? 
Discussion prompts:
	* How do we want to balance sharing Mozilla's work with the community and to listening to what the community has to say?
	* How is the festival's purpose reflected in the location?

Notes: 






2) How can MozFest  become a vehicle for movement building? 
Discussion prompts:
	* How can MozFest be used for leadership development?
	* Would multiple MozFests in different cities grow the movement or dilute it?
	* What would be the benefits and challenges of passing the reigns to community leaders in London, while we try something different in a new location?

Notes: 





3) What is the role of our MozFest partners?
Discussion prompts:
	* How do our current partners (Ravensbourne, BBC r&d, Met Office, Digital Me, EPIK, iRights, and now the Arts Award, Tate and VnA) contribute to the festival's success? 
	* How do we envision partnerships evolving by 2020, if we stay in London and/or if we move to a different city?

Notes:




What are the next steps for continuing this discussion?

Who are the other stakeholders we should include?

Have we made any decisions today that will significantly change the festival in 2017?



=================================
Original below

The future of MozFest
How can MozFest continue to evolve, be relevant to our strategy and valuable to our community.
Convenings are at the the front of our strategy, and MozFest is our biggest and brightest convening.

Q:What is the broad purpose of MozFest? Is it a chance for us to share our work with the community or to listen to what the community  have to say, ie the sessions they put forward?
If we want to share our work should we be somewhere we are a high value to the audience, have greater chance of spreading our work and ethos- being part of the larger pictures.
If we are using MozFest to listen to the community, what they are working on what they are debating and leveraging through session submissions. We will want to bring as many in as possible and be where they are most active or have the greatest chance of attending in large numbers.


Q:How is MozFest a vehicle for leadership development? Do we take the skeleton of the festival to another country and leave our communities leaders in place to lead in London?
As we think towards 2020 how to we see Mozfest playing that lead role on our convenings calendar as our largest and most public event - is this through one large event in the UK, small mini events around the world moving our partners and our teams or allowing our estabalished partners in the UK take the lead with our gudience and MoFo teams recreate another version of the event elsewhere- ie start again
Do we keep our UK event and creating a new version 2.0 in Asia or South America with new partners


Q Do our partners make our festival and are our asset, tool and resource or are they a vessel to attract new audience to our work? 
Should we be moving to a country where we have access to a larger audience know of our product but are not fully aligned.
Or should we move to where our most vocal audience/community is and use mozfest as a Leadership development tool
Creating smaller subset events, led by us in the MozFest frame but using local content and talent

Attendees:
	* 3 circle of attendees
		* Mozilla
		* Community and partners
		* Registered attendee and  invited guests- those who we want to work with, those who know what we do but dont necessarily agree with our work or align (yet ) with our work. This is always the largest group of new audience- this for me is our highest value


The venue

	* We stay in the UK not for our love of the city but for the love of the venue.
	* Its open, bright, well equipt, supportive. It is the epithonie of open, you can see all the floors, the heart of the festival.
	* We have embedded ourselves into their curriculum, their narrative, their academic program. 
	* We use their pool of student talent over the weekend from fire wardens, to rigging team, to graphic design team.
	* We have hired past students in contract postitions for roles within the production team, Marc Walsh and Dosed.
	* We mentor their events team, assist in leadership development
	* We already have an acedemic scholarhship and we are potentially about to enter into a larger post graduate partnership

The local partnerships-
BBC r&d, Met office, digital Me, EPIK, irights, and now the Arts Award, Tate and VnA



The cost
The are expanding at a fast rate and the cost of accommodating gets higher
Cost of good is increasing, contracters are expensive.
This is the 6th year in London, do we need to refresh!


Who are our stakeholders
As we take next steps who else should be involved in this conversation?


Wild card
Move next year but in 2018 move a portion of the event into more festival vibe, camping, summer, tents, fields, generators, music at night, sessions and talks during the day.

	* Collecting stories across hubs + Conversation that happened in global group + Hive portfolios
		* Who writes stories?
			* Claw tells staff to write them as blog posts
			* Study group leads
				* 
		* What is a story?
			* A meaty 
			* Mostly meta-data
				* Title
				* URL
				* contact
		* What are the goals?
			* Knowledge of and Insight on what's happening in our programs and network  - successes and challenges [primary] 
				* I said it's sad to think of all the lost stories and artifacts. Claw furthered: we are killing ourselves by not capturing this stuff from our programs in an accessible cross-org way. 
			* Capacity to tell our story more easily and with more impact
			* Reduce sadness +1 [goal #0]
			* Promotion / Recognition [primary/secondary]
			* Inspiring replication [secondary]
			* Helping people find useful stuff [secondary]
			* Connecting ppl to one another [secondary]
			* Inspiring good feelings :) [tertiary]
			* Attracting contributors [tertiary]
			* 
		* Notifications - how do we subscribe to stories?
	* Chat's role as a platform
		* It's missing people
		* participants and conversations are still mostly engineer focused, like in IRC
			* are there non-technical conversations that we're not aware of happening in non-engineering channels?
		* Worried about people adopting it
		* Slack
			* We left IRC because of ostensibly bad UX, but Mattermost isn't great in that department either.
			* A lot of people are using Slack already. We should "go where our users are" and not make them come to us.
			* Slack has an IRC adapter, so you can use it with non-Slack clients.
			* Slack has mobile clients and push notifications.
			* 
		* tl;dr: Slack disabled their ability to invite because they had too many users:
			*  https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html
		* It's difficult to build and deploy on Heroku (not a 12 factor app) and every release seems to break my super hacky custom buildpack.
	* What's happening with the things after this process? (Simon)


Things to follow-up on after this week:
	* Product rubric
	* Define goals re: stories ^
	* Prototype kiosk at mozfest for story telling, possibly 
	* Prototype integration with slack 
		* Vidyo?
		* Etherpads?
		* Event app
	* IA Changes that need to be made - This is captured in the going global work
		* Learning site
	* Figure out budget for mini-workweeks
	* We'll need more breakout space in Hawaii

Call for Proposals
Who are we inviting? 
How are we inviting?
What's our #MIMI plan?
Questions:
	* I’ve had a question about if it's web literacy - does it really include me? how does teaching/learning related to IoT, robotics, physical computing, fill-in-the-blank tech relate to our space?

GitHub Repo
https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2016
	How to use: 
		* Issues are submissions
		* Top comment is the official submission and should never be edited!
		* Labels will be space specific & searchable. 
		* Facilitators (submitters) will provide their first and second choice for what space they feel their session is most appropriate for. 
		* Later we will use the labels to help identify pathways.
		* June/July is the time to read the submissions. 
		* August is the time for curation.

	Etiqutte:
		* Facilitators will get an e-mail confirmation that their submission is available and public on GitHub.
		* We need to be mindful that any comments we write are public and available to facilitator

	New to Github? 
		* Github intro lesson with Erika - June 29th 08:00PST//11:00 ET//16:00 BST
		* Written tutorial - last year’s @ https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-program. They are working to update and I will update this link when it’s done.
		* Share your Github handle with Erika to get admin privileges

Open Badges
Need to think about open badges (https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozfest) - how do we want to incorporate? through particular sessions? through a pathway? through an experience in our space? Contact is Matt Rogers (matt.rogers@digitalme.co.uk, @mattdigitalme).
		* Robert to chat Marina about this

Closing Takeaways
	Takeaways: What is something you're leaving this call having gained (answers or questions)?
		* Clearer to-do's relating to the next process of picking sessions and a way to support those that are submitting sessions. Lot's of really cool ideas - very exciting.
		* Lots of understanding/information, lots of support, lots of great ideas, 
		* So much going on! I'm blown away by the activity: my key takeaway is that I feel much less in the drivers seat and much more on the bandwagon with you all now. So glad to see ownership and leadership developing... obviously this comes as we achieve greater clarity of purpose. I never expected any less from you all :) thanks for making my job easy :D
		* Feeling ever more prepared to make the "ask"

	Gratitude: What's something you appreciated from this group or an individual?
		* So much awesome progress being made already - thanks!!! 
		* Patience and the ongoing opportunities for acquisition of new skills 
		* Progress. Good to be a part of something that's moving forward fueled by lots of work and contributions from the team.
		* I'm grateful for your trust in stewarding this work and understanding as a juggle a number of personal/professional transitions.

	* Hall of Mirrors reminds me of the video going around about the man imprisoned for DUI beaming into the mirrors at men's rooms in bars. But we'd be lighter.
		* Reflective experiences/gallery walk
		* Fun house > fear house
	* The entry way needs to capture the spirit, but delimit traffic or be the only way into the space, right?
	* Question: Is the carnival/fun-house metaphor festival-wide or specific to this space?
		* The idea of showing people a haunted house and then taking them behind the scenes is great.
	* Potential things to connect/resurface:
		* Gaming space
		* A "room" people can control w/ IoT +1
			* We could cue some user controlled signage like the "panic inc sign"" https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/
		* Team Rogue stuff
	* It would be a good challenge for staff and allies to prepare rigorously to be "buskers" that are like mobile Ignite talks.
		* Can Luke & co. write webby songs and perform?
		* Place for music/music making w/ tech on the floor?
	* Opportunity for BreakoutEdu-like experience w/ open IoT or a walled garden themed breakout room? Do we have web artists who could install?
	* I saw a project once that printed "fortunes" based on tweets - thinking "Big" Zoltar +1 this is hilariously awesome. +1 we need this!!! anyone has a termal printer we could use?
		* This + a tweetbot workshop = return to connecting educators, new learners w/ developers doing weird, personal, human things in this space
	* I love the idea of a "ride" - "welcome to the internet, I will be your guide" needs to be present.+1, this is great.
	* Sounds fun = think it'll be in how we balance the theme with being not too-theme-y
//

Walk-through:
	* Entrance: Programmable signage
		* Live-coded marquee
		* improved littleBits signs?
		* Barker w/ scheduling materials in lieu of scheduling poster
		* Virtual tickets (can they sign up so we text people before a session they want to join begins?)
	* Pass through hall of mirrors (also opp to reconnect audience w/ web art, human touch)
		* space for wanderlust engagement
		* Lightbeam interaction
		* ascii art generator
	* Open space
		* hack jam space
		* programming space
		* sit down next to workers and ask questions, contribute, hand-off projects, improv learning
	* Session spaces branch off of open space
		* how many spaces?
			* make'em w/ dividers?
		* what kinds of proposals?
			* could be for sessions
			* could be for labs
			* could be for galleries
			* could be for arcades
		* documentation station
			* localize with us?
				* document in your own language idea
			* create a response and tweet it
	* Questions
		* Connections - will there be an IoT space? Will connected devices be spread out and in the science fair instead?
			* IoT everywhere - it's gone mainstream -
			* What's the anti-space group up to?
		* Linking to youth zone - one of the things I loved last year was most/best integration of young people throughout mozFest to date
	* Questions from Chad, FWTW. Disregard and move ahead as appropriate.
		* Agree w/ Andre re: comms, but also worry about the event itself - web literacy is for all; mentorship, service, and community projects connect to what we do, as well, and to emergent open leadership curriculum, FWIW. not clear on what the worry is
			* Is time spent convincing people that they can teach/they are teachers better than time spent on web lit is for all and you can share it, broadly?
		* Is there a metaphor that does more of what we want and less of what we don't want? (i.e. competing w/ YouthZone)
			* e.g. mentor fair
		* Is there some unpacking to do about YouthZone based on last year?
		* Are we learning, leadership, or web literacy space? Those inflections impact how I think about the space.

Outreach
	* Videos: 
		* Let's also use this if/when we can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTxPRi_LDOk 
	* should we push hard in/around London?
	*

Thoughts from Chad
Last year because of the number of sessions that created some divisions between our pedagogical and technical (developer) sides in learning.
Aurelia was doing subjective mapping with CartoDB – this was missed by people because it wasn't in the open
How do we "close the loop" between membership in our learning community and those few people who build the next generation of open on the Web

STUFF from other places...

		* YOUR INPUT: What's Our (Learning Team) Purpose?
			* What's the statement we want to make about our work to people who join us at MozFest? How do you interpret our unique value-add at Mozilla. Say it In as few characters as possible. The most succinct but complete and accurate statement wins! The prize is my admiration and deep respect ;)
				* Hands on, participatory contribution and learning that equate building an open and inclusive web with building open and inclusive community
					* Inclusion, Contribution, Revolution +1+1
					* A collaborative, inclusive and innovative space to advance the open web revolution.
				* To unlock agency and expand opportunities through our hands-on participatory awesome events and content
				* To advance the promise of the Internet for learning (stolen from Building Networks Team convo planned for later today; Hivey)
					* Love this one!+1+1

				* Connecting people to projects, opportunities and other people to advance web literacy while making an impact in their communities 
				* rallying communities to shape the agenda, create impact, and future cast technology for learning 

		* Your Input: What do you want to see MORE of in the MLN Mozilla Learning (< thank you) Space at MozFest this year?
			* More interactive learning aka learning from each other through engaging activities (less session-based) +1
			* More free time to network and meet everyone. +1+1+1+1+1
			* Loved the Global Village space last year - would love to see our space embody all the places people learn (museum area with Tate Modern activities, library, classroom, community space, home, etc.)   +1+1
				* Hmmmm, this is intriguing. I don't wanna rip off the global village, but we could totally do a museum, library, community center, science center... maybe there is a way to do this via pathways and across other spaces... brain juices flowing :)
			* Customizable space <- can you say more about this? Sounds intriguing.thinking bean bags, boxes, lighting, just to make corners and chats more comfortable and unique. I loved the "quiet space" from a couple years ago...also, just want a reason to build forts - ah, like a modular DIY space. love it. also love forts. +1 for fortsyes! modular DIY ;)
			* Live Mozilla Curriculum Workshop recording with participants that are attending <-- this needs to happen! +1 +1 also talked to Bobby, think a pop-up podcast zone for all MozFest would be put to good use LOVE PODCASTS <3 <3 <3+1
			* IoT, connected home goodness, I want our space to feel even more like "Teh Future"
			* Early release of call for session proposals +1
				* I'd like to do this via the community wranglers... even if proposal calls get delayed, people should be ready to hit submit on day 1 because we've prepped them and spread the word.
			* More local educators and youth jumping in and out of the space - take advantage of the community we've gathered locally and engage them! ( I like how Su's making station did this last year)I can make introductions with key partners here in London and the UK- would be awesome to plug them in earlier to spaces so they feel more involved

==========================================================================
Check-in w/ Kim & Robert on 4/18

Questions:
	* Who has traditionally been the target audience for MozFest? For MLN? For participants? For facilitators?
		* this is a good question without a simple answer (as always). OK, the simple answer: 
			* For MozFest in general: advocates for the open web.
			* For MLN: mostly our friends and community members; educators using or co-creating Mozilla resources, who have traditionally been out-of-school time or informal educators and these days are club captains; Some (small) number of random walk-ins or local formal educators; 
		* Who are we trying to reach this year AND who *can* we reach?
			* Non-local, non-Mozilla folks tend to have stipends: they submit a good proposal, they're accepted, we stipend their travel OR they're already close friends we know we want to be there;
			* unpack what reach looks like:
				* local vs. remote – bring people in live without having to be there
				* direct vs. indirect – does activity at MozFest extend beyond MozFest (train the trainer, design for audiences)
					* our direct audience doesn't have to be our target audience
					* our focus could be "reach the most learners possible"

	* Who has shown up in the past? Do we have demographic info? Do we know why they show up? What they love & what they want to see improved?
		* Not great data on this. Mostly it's folks who either a) can afford a ticket to London, b) are sent there on Mozilla funds, or c) are Europeans, namely Brits. There's an incredible diversity for a tech gathering, but a more modest one for what you might expect from a global gathering;

	* What new experiences, backgrounds, ideas, thoughts do we want to see represented at MozFest? What are their barriers for entry?
		* This is a great question, it's exactly the sort of thing that I can take to our team for some input!

	* What does DARCI mean?
		* It's a decision/responsibility matrix adapted from RACI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix
		* We add D for Decider in order to make power dynamics transparent. The Decider has ultimate oversight;
		* You can see a drafty DARCI below for this work;
				* Decider: TBD
				* Accountable: Robert (w/ support from Kim)
				* Responsible: Community Wranglers
					* Kim
					* Su
					* Simeon
				* Consulted/Helping:
					* Amira Dhalla
					* Julia Vallera
					* Chad Sansing
					* Andre Garzia
					* Simona Ramkisson
					* Lainie DeCoursy
				* Learning:
					* 
				* Informed: 
					* Learning Team
					* Learning Community

	* So many cool ideas are being shared/incubated during the teachtheweb curriculum workshops. How can we facilitate their next steps?
		* This is exactly on point. That's what we'll want to do over the next 2-3 months. Create a space that invites folks participation and motivate them to show up!

TODOs for Friday 22 call
	* Kim: Follow-up with Chad about us doing a curriculum workshop on preparing a proposal for MozFest 
	* Robert : get a list of all the Mozilla Learning Activities.
		* working on this... got some information, need to compile
	* Robert: Try to get some feedback from the MozFest crew on demographics of attendees (where do they come from);
		* They don't collect this information!!! We've got nothing to answer this question with.
		* Trying to get a sense of what % of attendees were funded by Mozilla to attend.



==========================================================================
Staff Crew Check-in on 4/12

Agenda
	* (15 min) Let's get it all out there!
	* (5 min) Robert's Approach
	* (10 min) Timeline & Logistics
	* (15 min) What's missing
	* (5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude


(15 min) Let's get it all out there!
What brings you to the call this morning? What's your MozFest passion? 
If a MadLib helps here, let's go with: I'm joining this crew to make sure __________________ is represented and/or we don't let _________________ happen again.
	* Andre: I'm joining this crew to make sure fun and creativity +1 are represented in all our actions
		* too many sessions crammed into a short time!
		* my favorite mozFest thing is EXPLORING! I love to wander around and be surprised by stuff.  I wish this could be facilitated.
	* Julia: I am joining to make sure we build new relationships/friendships through simple FUN +1 so we don't exhaust people again. (been exausted there before, know the feeling)+1
	* Simona: I'm joining to make sure to make sure is that we grow and better embed the inclusion and diversity piece is represented in more than one dedicated space and that we see it anchored in core programming i.e speakers, spaces and sessions +1+1 +1
		* quality of sessions was affected by...
		* making sure that people feel like this is a place to come back and work again
		* Working with speakers and session leaders – logistics and facilitation are not completely removed from each other +1
	* Chad: I'm joining to make sure we create inclusive, welcoming spaces for playing, making, and learning outside sessions and other more formal spaces; I'd like to make sure we don't lose large, widely differentiate-able spaces for hackery. +1 (2016 is the year of the sandwich printer) YAH.
		* The part that blew my mind as a first-time participant was having the time and agency to choose which worthwhile thing to do in depth over the whole weekend in community - there was nothing like that in traditional NA public education for me until I could bring some back. <3
	* Robert: I'm gonna add my two cents below ;) +1 to everything above!
	* 

Do you have an idea(s) or things in the works that we should definitely know about?
	* See Amira's TEAM ROGUE LEARNING notes below or in this pad: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfestteamrogue (feel free to add notes or ideas!) <3 <3 <3 this pad, so many good ideas!!! plusses+1
	* I would like to see an incubator/hacker/maker space. <-- I want this too! 
	* I would like to see some sessions become a combined ignite sessions to "zip" the amount of content in a fun, rigorous way for folks who enjoy such talking events.
	* It would be great to have a space session that kicks off Mozfest similar what AMC did on teaching people to be good listeners, supportive 
		* Seconded :) 
		* third - music/movement is good to warm up
	* Can we have MLN Picnic?
		* Bring your own sandwich supplies, put them into the Run, Sandwich, Run! arrays, and eat what you generate. I have some tomato and lettuce toners here... :)+1
	* I would like designated time for reflection at the end - it was very helpful to do this with our Diverse leaders folks last year
	* Web Literacy Leaders - this program (developed by An-Me and Chad/me) and its first cohort will likely launch ahead of MozFest. We would like MozFest to be an opportunity for them to have a F2F gathering and some responsibility for sharing the OER they develop or facilitating/sprinting on related work.

Flags
	* Youth Zone – when they ran out of room they annexed the MLN space in a way that was disruptive
	* There is a tension between giving wranglers and "pathfinders" agency in organizing the work and then relatively late-appearing instructions from the event team.

(5 min) Robert's Approach
Robert shares what he'd like to make sure that we lead with...
	* Doing less means compromising more (appreciate the difficulty here)
	* We let our community space wrangler lead and make decisions that are informed by our deep knowledge of this space, but driven by them
	* 

	* Questions
		* What are the mechanisms to make sure the team is informed?
			* let's deep dive on that below here, but basic piece is that Robert is the go-between and we can create new spaces for doing that too, but their not 
		* Can we make a DARCI for this?
			* YES! Good call:
				* Decider: ??? Not 100% Sure but guessing Sarah?
				* Accountable: Robert
				* Responsible: Community Wranglers
				* Consulted: MLN Staff MozFest Crew
				* Informed: Whole MLN Team
			* Deadlines, clear accountability and expectations are key 
				* Strong suggestion is to reverse engineer a schedule from last year w/ best guess deadlines and mentor texts shared ASAP.
					* thanks Chad, this is great.
			* We are using a variation of DARCI here in Rio which might be a good idea for MozFest with the following roles:
					* One person responsible < this is what we call accountable and I would stick to that language
					* Any number of people consulted/helping < I would call "helping" as responsible
					* Any number of people as LEARNERS/apprentices on that task < I like this... need to think about it a little bit, but the spirit is great maybe also "shadowing"
				* So with this system we usually have 1 responsible person, 2 people being consulted and helping and 1 or 2 apprentices learning about that type of task.


(10 min) Timeline & Logistics
	* April – solicit staff and community member input that can inform our Purpose Statement at the Berlin MozFest retreat
		* Robert to use weekly MLN staff calls to get staff input
		* Wranglers to use regional coordinator calls, club captain emails, Hive calls, community calls, curriculum calls, etc. to solicit input
	* May – Berlin retreat: nail down space logistics and determine a Purpose Statement for the Mozilla Learning space at MozFest
		* Before we as a team begin to really plan out the logistics for things like what's in Amira's pad we should invite our community to respond to us.
			* Time is a major blocker here;
			* Can we create a hybrid? Where we are prepared but also accommodate folks;
		* Socialize this out with our staff and communities ASAP to get their interpretations
		* Suggestion: Have a timeline and mentor texts for the first task coming out of the retreat.
			* what do you mean by "mentor text" 
				* "Here is what you should comment on GH to 'claim' a session." "Here is an acceptance email." "Here is an email extending a travel stipend." "Here is a Google Form you can send to get passport and travel information from stipended presenters."
		* Suggestion: Try to establish an expectation of how much time there will be from each ask until its task is due (say 2 weeks or whatever) and commit to having mentor texts/resources/calls schedules ready to go out with each ask.
		* Suggestion: Begin office hours for community space wranglers. Maybe rotate as staff helpers. Every two weeks starting in May; we each do two w/ Robert or an event team member?
		* Suggestion: Prep and practice with a dummy repo if we're using GH again and share processes for articulating the differences between labels and milestones and resolving conflicts between groups that want the same session.
		* Suggestion: Community Wranglers Podcast. Get them all talking about the experience, share their stories! Boom.
		* Suggestion: badges? Recognize all their efforts...
	* June – Request for proposals opens! 
		* Use community calls and spaces to motivate proposals
	* July
		* Suggestion: do something in July so as not to lose momentum; maybe work with space wranglers to develop kick-off events modeled after inclusion work? Participation guide for Mozfest?+1
	* August – Start proposal review
	* September – Send acceptances < i wish this could happen sooner +1+!+1(also if it comes to if funding is involved) OK, I'll try to get a better assessment of this so we can feel reassured or anticipate this as a major blocker.
			* Volunteers/Mozilla Community goes crazy with anxiety waiting for acceptance letters  (or maybe it was just me) yap.


(15 min) What's missing
What is missing from the plan above? What/who should we include in this plan?
	* July.
	* Roadmap for community wranglers so they never feel lost.
	* Inclusion deep-dive in session evaluation, selection, and planning  -  from Simona. +1 from Chad.
	* Answer me this: How do we ensure that we are doing our utmost best to deliver quality programming - from Simona. +1 from Chad.
	* Time and space for co-designing the kinds of spaces and events we'd like BEFORE the last three weeks before MozFest - from Julia. +1 from Chad +1+1
	* Can we sync the topics for the curriculum workshop events with the areas inside the MLN space so that our calls pave the way to mozFest? 
		* Kinda sorta - we try to follow the MLN editorial calendar, but we also break ranks sometimes to support specific projects with time-constrained needs; so....definitely for a summer episode, but maybe not for all 3 summer episodes? Definitely for October? Thats good! If we have just a number of calls in sync that already shows movement towards mozFest which is the whole idea. :D
		* We can start spinning this up w/ planning for calls after May, which is set on youth civic engagement.


(5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude
How to stay connected? How do you want to be involved?
	* Staying connected beyond calls: Can we have a space on the mattermost/chat.mozillafoundation.org thing? It would allow for cool async comms and also for informal chats!+1
	* Keep this group as the consulted staff team – bi-weekly meetings

What is your takeaway from this call? What is the single most important thing you are leaving with or excited about? How would you like to remain included?
	* Excited to have more time to plan and that we will have three community members to build this with
	* Structuring the process ahead of time, but not the product, shows both care for our wranglers and trust in them.
	* Definitely big +1 on the start time this year 
	* I loved all the fresh ideas and how mozFest will be always kept on the bleeding edge of awesomeness thanks to you folks.
	* 

Kudos, thanks, acknowledgements, positive reinforcements, things to work on next, constructive feedback:
	* To Robert for all the awesome work
	* Major love to this team! 
	* Robert le Robert - wrangle on! This is a great team to be a part of - thoughtfulness and compassion abound with deep expertise.'Ca
	* 
	* Thank you all for your deep knowledge and commitment to making this awesome! Keep the feedback coming.

Notes from Check-In w/ Amira Dhalla on 4/11

\/\/\/\/TEAM ROGUE LEARNING\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfestteamrogue

	* Engaging staff to vision what they think is cool and fun
	* Having sessions that respond to the theme, but having areas that really produce experiences
	* We have SO MANY, WAY TOO MANY sessions in our space and staff never get to go and attend other sessions
	* For staff (and maybe anyone) we're focused on aspects where we can dip in and out
	* A three-day long experience may be the wrong level of commitment
	* A place where people can discuss challenges and opportunities will work for some folks
	* A good example of a good experience:
		* David Ascher think at Orlando
		* A teach the web relay-race – something like the science sprint or Laura Hillger's science sprint
		* or a weekend-long skill-share handoff – sit down, learn a skill, hand it off to the next person before they leave

On getting broad community input
	* If we're getting community input, we need to set some clear boundaries and manage expectations about how input will be used
	* Simeon or others can definitely take 5 minutes and then there's a monthly email that goes to all coordinators and club captains – Amira is definitely the best POC

Notes from All-Hands session
	* Concerns around "carnival" theme
		* interpretation of carnival
	* Need to contextualize the theme for different audiences - connect to different outcomes we're after
	* Need better articulation of what the value is for coming to mozfest / facilitating 

Making the invitation to mozfest more inviting - making the web more inviting
Help fuel how mozilla approaches learning in 2017 and beyond

Who do we want to invite to propose sessions? Who does an excellent job of creatively teaching others about the web - add to http://mzl.la/mozfest2016-mln-invites


MSL Mozfest

Questions to be answered on line: 

Retreat: Joey, Richard, Arliss & Kirstie

What do you want to get out of Mozfest this year? Like 2015? Dislike?

Pathways didn't work so well last year.
Ppl did like the idea of way to move through floors

Here is proposal:
https://mozillafestival.org/proposals

Arts & Culture would like to find some sort of way to incorporate art into each of the spaces,
If there are types of proposals we'd like to see (e.g. data collection into art, etc) put that out in a separate call to our community through email / newsletter / social media

Doing the GitHub issues selection process again.

STIPENDS
If like last year, will get about ten stipends.
Depending on where folks are coming from, you will get reasonable amt for getting them here.
* DOES NOT cover visas.

Stipend possibilities:
	* Amel
	* Fatma
	* Azza
	* Anelda
	* Nifras


SWAG
* What are we going to put at coffee stations?
* Don't wait til last minute -  sooner rather than later
* Ship to London office or Richard?
* Tattlys

INTERACTIVE GAMES
* DNA last year
* ideas for this year?
* use hashtags for tweets to fill color in MSL logo
* passports to color in logo or stamps to collect
* collect different Tattlys for different sessions / types of session


QUESTIONS:
	* Are the stipends also supposed to cover our community members (Joey, Richard & Kirstie)?
		* Check w/ Pamela re: fellows coverage since fellow alumni are expected to welcome new fellows
		* Check w/ Sarah how Kirstie is covered
			* Convo w/ Sarah: Kirstie is covered
			* Fellows are to be covered on Fellows
			* All hotel rooms are allocated for all of them per her email in June

Connections

Reps, MLN
1:1s with community members really changed the levels of engagement
--> is this scale-able? 
--> Guillermo - working on having reps coach each other, best practices on this would be very useful (eg dealing with challenge re: scale + communication (online & in person) - particularly online in Africa)
--> how to determine the value of this work overall through coaching and 1:1 support

Learning Hub, curriculum
How to take this curriculum to scale and use it in other places?
- financial tools have mostly been an example
- a lot of the training re: how does data get to my phone? etc
- DSO is not teaching financial skills/services specifically, focusing on teaching digital/web literacy skills more generally --> assumption is that people are more likely to teach themselves relevant apps/etc if they have an overall understanding/strong grasp on web literacy
- "all web literacy is local"

Research
Best practices re: how to take the lessons learned from this smaller intervention and scale/have broader assumptions about demographics
- the danger is that you don't want to do marketing research and call it ethnography

Mozilla clubs
- Clubs are working very hands-on with older women, esp in Africa, re: how to use financial systems to support their small businesses + financial literacy
- can use this to tell a larger story re: what we're doing in this work overall
- can also add to lessons learned?
- piloting a 'club'-type work in Nairobi
- connect w/Amira re: women & web literacy hub re: research

Outstanding questions + "to dos"
- how to meet people where they are? eg people who are already using Facebook, only familiar with Facebook online
- An-Me to connect w/CEO of banking system in Kenya (Equity?)
- explore connection between DSO (Laura/Bobby) + women & web literacy (Amira) + veterans (An-Me) case studies re: web literacy & economic empowerment 
- test w/Amira's audience as well

BRAINSTORM

Impact
- How does this impact the 5 issues/strategic plan? Is there a through-line we can draw to 1 or more issues?
- Helping to flesh out the "so what" of web literacy - why should people care?
--> is the goal getting people into (a more) formal financial system or the formal economy? (subtle, but important difference)

(Possible) Output (s)
- open research practices: basic best practices to share (eg. how do you gather some initial user info re: opportunities/challenges before you go out and build a thing)
---> for Mozilla, but also in the wild!!
---> different research methods (eg. ethnography, participatory action research, etc) + resources
- Meta-analysis re: how people are gathering data across the org, best & most common practices
- Process by which people learned the web lit skills that led to them becoming more web literate
--> process for developing the curriculum (eg how you gathered and incorporated culturally relevant examples/contexts into it)
--> story of decision process re: how and why they decided to incorporate technical skills into the web literacy curriculum
- assumption/theory of change: getting people to understand how to take and apply web literacy skills, technical skills are necessary but not the main focus
- lessons learned & best practices re: a Northern organization doing research in the global south
- is this a remixable model?

Comms
- use "web literacy" consistently (not digital literacy)
- Common sound/look/feel for research papers + place to find them --> there are a lot coming together all over the place, would be helpful to have a template/resource
---> a set of questions + branding
---> Best practices re: what a funder would look for in this research (eg. evidence of X)
- Where does this get shared publicly? How do we make it easy to find?
- DSO (Laura/Bobby) + women & web literacy (Amira) + veterans (An-Me) case studies re: web literacy & economic empowerment 
--> useful as a comms piece
--> also useful as demo re: what we mean by web literacy
- locally relevant stories around our issues agenda?

Beyond
...!

			* Promotion
			* Selection of sessions
			* ID pathways
			* WOW / Leadership Training + Testing at MozFest
			* Running sessions
	* Study Group 
		* Test out an in-person regional onboarding

		* anna: try it out for a year with 2-3 events 
	* Need to have a way of providing access beyond smaller, invited events
	* Maybe targeting labs / educators / PIs / librarians

How are we measuring progress:

	* Size
		* # of participants across events
		* Project Leads
		* Study Group Leads
		* Fellows

	* Connectivity - looking at strength of connections // 
		*  who else others engage with in the network
		*  how do you collaborate with those folks? (collaborator -> general acquaintance)

	* Retention
		* Sustaining momentum and engagement
		* Levelling up / providing opportunities for participants to get actively involved. 

NOTES:

	* are there ways to, through personalized engagement and shorter calls (rather than flying a big group to one location) to help inject shared values, support, etc?
	* rob: got involved because he was interested in it, was on the calls, joined the sprint. 
		* image for open science at Mozilla - how different is that vs how others are approaching open science? 
		* 


Questions:
	*  Who are "members"?
		* People who see a connection to Mozilla, and actively participating in Mozilla efforts.
		* How to turn up the dial so that others feel ownership of this work / part of the movement? 

		*  Are you identifying with the work itself or the organization.?
			* Get to shared value first (versus Mozilla Mozilla ra-ra / framing materials about contributing solely to Mozilla)

		* What are the smaller ways that people can get more engaged in the community (knowing we can't bring everyone to London)

    
 Soundbytes:
	* Rob: "I didn't feel disconnected before, but now I feel more a part of it and ownership of this." <3   
	* Anna: think about conferences as distribution points

********************************
MozFest 2016 Marketing
********************************

Paul
Kevin
Sarah
Erika
special guest appearance: Mark Surman

Problem statement: Still really hard for people to understand WTF MozFest is.

To Do: Use marketing to help people understand why they want to come. 

Kristie’s story:
1 - MozFest got on her radar
2 - at first she was skeptical. WTF is this and why should I care?
3 - interested
4 - high level participation

^ how do we recreate that journey for others?
^ test that hypothosis

Language:
	* Our current language is self-referential and generic. “A community of people” could apply to the NRA. Get rid of the language that doesn’t say much.
	* Don’t need to skew the language too far into movement-building. Won’t appeal to the entire MozFest audience, especially if they've never been.
	* Experience brand of MozFest while you’re there is really strong. But how do we attract new people?
	* Look at other conferences that have weird, arcane content. How do they market their events.


MozFest website:
	* Language feels old and stale. Need to stop re-using it.
	* Does the MozFest site become a respository for the outputs from the event?

Plan of Action:
1) Work Mark's thoughts into V2 of the speech bubble/messaging brief
2) Once that's got Mark's signoff, work it into the comms plan template
3) Comms plan will identify how we want to reach out to people
4) In parallel, reach out to space wranglers to find the list of people we want to reach out to
5) Roll this all back together into a comms



	* Part 1: Share design vision: Each designer gives a lightning talk about a design hero, where they see design going, and from these two things a quality, attribute or project Mozilla design should embrace. Our goal here is to expand our design vision as a group, and highlight ideas that could impact design across MOCO and MOFO.
		* Activity - talk about heroes, trends, sacred things, baggage
		* Outcome - deeper an understanding of what makes each other tick, and some inspiration to bring back to our projects. 
		* Impact - could inform some content on our design repo home, could reignite principals stuff, inform brand/identity input

	* Part 2: Mozilla rebrand hack: MOCO branding has defined Mozilla brand attributes. Do they align with the design attributes we defined in 2015? Let’s evaluate and leave with a shared set of attributes we express every time we design a product or project.
		* Context: Ideally a couple of designers attend the Brand open house Wednesday, 6/15 at 4:00 PM in the Metropole Hotel []
		* Prep: Links, slides, and print outs of the MOCO branding attributes and our 2015 design attributes
		* Activity
			* discuss and document feedback
			* Review moodboards https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Design/issues/39
		* Outcome – feedback goes to advisory committee
		* Impact – a moar awesome brand that serves our advocacy and the Network 

	* Part 3: MOFO design repo: Will start with a postmortem on collaborative design studio efforts since Whistler. What worked, what didn't, what do we want to do next. Big question, how do we want to work in the new org structure. (MLN / Advocacy) ? What do we expect from each other moving forward?
		* Context: We need a home for recruitment, universal alignment, and resource gathering. We lost our page on build dot mofo and might benefit from something on an independent repo. 
		* Prep: 
			* https://github.com/mozilla/build.webmaker.org/issues/104
		* Goal: Have a home for
			* Recruiting 
			* Universal design
			* Assets
			* Principles etc
		* Activity: 
			* Dig up and review prior build dot mofo content
			* Review benchmarks
				* https://standards.usa.gov/
			* Discuss iteration
			* Use of moodboards
			* Talk about Learning and other sites and how do handle transitional styles that will always transitional
MLN Metrics & Convenings Discussion
All-Hands London

WHEN:      Jun 17 2016 @ 11:30 AM BST
WHERE:    Great Western One

Session Lead:  Arliss (Data & Metrics Lead, MLN )

Description:

This session will dig into the relationship between metrics and convenings for the remainder of 2016, digging into how convenings map to increased activity + engagement from communities, strategy for data collection and participant analysis, and ultimately retention (staying engaged after the convening, looking at ways to continue engagement).

Thank you for joining this session ... please add your name and affiliation below
	* Arliss - Mozilla Leadership Networks
	* Lainie - Mozilla Leadership Network
	* Abby - MLN
	* Sarah- Convenings
	* ErikaD - Convenings
	* Aurelia - MLN/MSL


Suggested Attendees:
	* Sarah Allen (Convenings)
	* Erika Drushka (Convenings)
	* Aurelia (Mozilla Science Lab)
	* Anna, Rob and Christie (Mozilla Science Community Members)

Possible Attendees:
	* Jenn Beard
	* Hana Sun
	* Kaitlin
	* Simon
	* Lainie
	* Kenyatta
	* Sam B


Talking Points:

	* Introduction

	* Amazing work done to-date by Adam Lofting
		* KPI: ‘Network Strength’ - proposed late 2015
			* A measure that captures the health, resilience, size and influence of the network.

			* Factors that contribute to Network Strength (sub KPIs):
				* Network Size -- Number of active members
				* Network Connectivity -- Number and strength of connections between members
				* Network Alignment -- How strongly members identify with Mozilla and our "issues"
				* Member Influence / Reach -- Using our leadership tiers - need to develop how we measure this and what data to collect

		* This work will give us more than a KPI - we’ll be able to see the network and use the visualizations to inform program design, convenings, etc.
		* Reflect changes in: connectivity, alignment, size and reach of MLN in a way that encourages programme designers to make the network stronger.  How and when we do this is part of what will be developed in H2.

	* How is this incorporated into out Convenings - these are the questions we should be thinking about ...
		* How can we increase the # of people that get our survey - ie. member contact information
		* How can we increase the # of people that answer the survey
		* How can we increase the number of connections that our members are making - ie. adding new members and connecting them with existing members
		* How can we make these connections stronger
		* How can we increase their alignment with our issues and Mozilla
		* 

	* Next Steps:
		* Research  the current role data collection has in the MLN hubs
		* We did not have historic data specific to this KPI, so we could not yet set useful targets. After establishing baseline data in H1, we aim to set initial targets in H2
		* Status
			* We have established a way to capture network data through our survey
			* We need to turn this data into a number that can function as the current ‘score’ for our Network Strength KPI - this has been completed
			* We need a process to capture this data at regular intervals throughout MLN

	* Q & A
		* Piloted survey with Hive(members, mostly New York), Clubs (captains) and Science Lab - looking at individual networks to help us get to baselines
		* Can we see the graphs/results? Can we see the number?
			* https://docs.google.com/document/d/17NQKl7QdlpxdAaDkm36Gtlxla6WHTu1Qn1OJ0xktMYo/edit# thx!
		* Will also be helpful for hub folks to know other ways to plug in data here
		* What kind of data are we allowed to collect? POI data is sensitive.



NOTES:
incentive, something to encourage people to fill out the survey
who do we give the survey to - cap the number
need to be in continual contact with people if you are going to keep the data
can't contact poeple after 6 months
Use MozFest registration form
At MozFest - find a fun way to collect information from participants  - assign some people to do the data collection
Post-convening surveys
Asked for github handle at MozFest 2016
Project Magnet
Give people something back for the feedback you give them
H2 MLN data audit? towards more streamlined data capturing and analysis, and better connections to Network Strength KPI
JUNE LONDON WORKWEEK 

Community Engagement Onboarding: Clubs, Study Groups, Cohorts
mzl.la/communities

Where: London, UK

CLUBS

	What 
		A Mozilla Club meets regularly in-person to learn how to read, write and participate with the web in an inclusive and engaging way. We currently have 230 Mozilla Clubs in 100+ cities around the world. 
	Who
		Educators (formal or informal)
		Advocates
		Students
	Why 
		 Grassroots movement to get web literacy into communities and teach the web on the ground. 
		
	Links
		Fact Sheet: http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/ 
		Training: https://mozilla.teachable.com/courses (online training program)
		Events Report http://mozilla.github.io/clubs-events/
		Site https://learning.mozilla.org/clubs (being updated soon)
		Calls https://learning.mozilla.org/community (same as learning network + 1 RC call a month)
		Guides and Resources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dpU02AiN2otBuN0W4Xt9cbIDMpBd3jKKLPs_1QsxeQo/edit#gid=0 
	How to improve
		More overt rewards and recognition program to being involved and for our RCs (and club captains)
		Better onboarding and retaining of our RCs
		Adapt and create local content - work towards better l10n

Notes:
	* Focus is quality over quantity - powerful / effective strategy
	* Focus on web literacy building globally
	* Importance of training people locally to do the work on the ground (rather than us running/facilitating the clubs directly)
	* Comms
		* Regular emails
		* Monthly call
		* Open hours
	* How is the event report site being used - primarily for us to know what's happen, or for club captains to see what's happening elsewhere
		* Way to connect RCs and club captains with each other
		* -AND- way for us to track what's happening
		* Will think about incentives/rewards for people inputting events
		* Google form - feeds database and also inputs to github
	* Do you know how many participants come?
		* Event reporter asks for # of participants
	* What are requirements/expectations for RCs
		* 2-15 hrs/week (ranges based on area, context, phase)
		* recruiting club captains, providing support
	* How do you assess (quality/learning) and onboarding?
		* some built-in assessment during online training
		* feedback - we ask regularly (email and community call)
	* Mmaki - based in university in Cape Town
		* Club Captains are graduates of the Information Systems degree
		* They have autonomy on how they create their clubs - but with the web lit map as an underpinning, and to weave in their existing academic content
	* Ani - based in Pittsburgh
		* Working at the municipal level - working with parks, for instance
	* Andre - based in Rio
		* working towards rewarding shadowing and mentoring - young participants who move through the lessons more quickly, help their peers
		* partner with local university - students get credit for hours spent with the club


STUDY GROUPS

	What
		The Study Group Project at Mozilla is a suite of tools for semi-regular and informal meetups on open source, open science, and open practice for researchers, students, librarians, and academics.
		Currently have 202 study group
	Why
		To give early career researchers a healthy introduction to Open Science practice and give them an opportunity to connect with (and teach their) peers
	Who
		Researchers
		Librarians
		Students
		Academics (mostly)
		Contacts here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BzyS1UJvAj68HQx6xCinQTikCnKaI-T9nXx_LC714yA/edit#gid=0

	How to improve
		Standardize documentation
		Make the online map interactive (https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups)
		Clean up some of the engineering behind the study group workflow, and simplify infrastructure
		Connect with other groups (Clubs + Cohorts)
		Build more communities and develop and Ambassadors network
		Create onboarding/orientation for SG Leads
			aim to launch in sept, and have that be a connection point (get study group leads talking via gitter, calls, etc.)
			create cohorts by onboarding folks 2x/year

Notes:
	* Participants fork a github repo when they start a club
	* Events reported via jackyl (sp?) blog
	* Groups may meet weekly, monthly, quarterly
	* Group sets themes around science/coding 
	* Library of 40 lessons with suggestions in markdown
	* Git can sometimes be a blocker
	* Public Seminar - part of New School Endangered Scholars program - platform for sharing curriculum, projects, sequences - all narrative based
	* Rob themes
		* Getting people to share code within their lab - researchers write computational reports
		* better practices in coding (version control via git), collaboration, tool-sharing
	* How do study groups connect to each other?
		* monthly calls
		* leads interact with each other informally (twitter, social, email)
		* contribute back lessons
	* Mainly at the graduate level - what might be additional incentives (ability to raise small grants, teaching experience, etc.)
		* main motivation is helping on their research projects 



OPEN LEADERSHIP COHORT (OLC)

	What 
		The Open Leadership Cohort (OLC) is a group of about 30 researchers that the Mozilla Science Lab engages in mentorship over a few months leading up to an opportunity that showcases their project/study group/ community work. These folks are inducted via a Working Open Workshop (WOW) and mentored every two weeks via half-hour meetings with MSL and affiliate staff, culminating in their participation in Mozfest/Global Sprint.
		
		Currently have 30 OLC members
	Why
		We wanted a way to content with great candidates  doing awesome work in our community, but outside the fellowship program, we'd also like to groom them as mentors as we build our network.
	Who
		Researchers
		Fellow Applicants (not accepted)
		Study Group Leads
		Project Leads (Collaborate)

	How to improve
		Build materials for post-Global Sprint or event engagement
		Plan ways of fostering mentorship between Cohort 1 and Future Cohorts
		Connect the Cohort 1 with Cohort 2 (Chicago) + Study Groups + Clubs


Cross-opportunities
	* Science - looking at "ambassador program" - RC-type mentoring model (currently Mozilla staff 1:1)
	* Better connect people locally (science study leads with RCs/club captains
		* Regional Coordinators
			* not paid, but grants possibly available to help out
			* not metrics-driven
			* about 2-4 hours a week, time reduces after good establishment
			* fills whole week for some (15 hours a week)
			* regional coordinators have 5-10 clubs
		* Quality over quantity
			* just been revamping onboarding - email strategy with kristina
			* launched training platform
		* Channels
	* Offboarding - checking in with folks when they become inactive - what can we learn about why
		* maybe it's a 6 month group?
		* clubs are difficult to compare because so diverse
		* trying to get to this in Study Groups with the onboarding process
		* shaddow programs + academic hours at universites
	* Engagement for clubs
		* High school engagement in clubs + municipal partnerships (pittsburgh)
	* Sharing resources
		* A system of movement and graduation - lifecycle (mozilla club as a teenager, graduates to study groups)
		* Modifying study group model from research audience to open web language
		* Translation for study groups
	* l10n
		* Andre working on new webapp that may be helpful for translating science content
	* Curriculum template - community generated curriculum/guides
	* Attaching humans to guides
