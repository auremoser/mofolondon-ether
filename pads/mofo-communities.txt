CLUBS

	What 
		A Mozilla Club meets regularly in-person to learn how to read, write and participate with the web in an inclusive and engaging way. We currently have 230 Mozilla Clubs in 100+ cities around the world. 
	Who
		Educators (formal or informal)
		Advocates
		Students
	Why 
		 Grassroots movement to get web literacy into communities and teach the web on the ground. 
		
	Links
		Fact Sheet: http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/ 
		Training: https://mozilla.teachable.com/courses (online training program)
		Events Report http://mozilla.github.io/clubs-events/
		Site https://learning.mozilla.org/clubs (being updated soon)
		Calls https://learning.mozilla.org/community (same as learning network + 1 RC call a month)
		Guides and Resources https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dpU02AiN2otBuN0W4Xt9cbIDMpBd3jKKLPs_1QsxeQo/edit#gid=0 
	How to improve
		More overt rewards and recognition program to being involved and for our RCs (and club captains)
		Better onboarding and retaining of our RCs
		Adapt and create local content - work towards better l10n

Notes:
	* Focus is quality over quantity - powerful / effective strategy
	* Focus on web literacy building globally
	* Importance of training people locally to do the work on the ground (rather than us running/facilitating the clubs directly)
	* Comms
		* Regular emails
		* Monthly call
		* Open hours
	* How is the event report site being used - primarily for us to know what's happen, or for club captains to see what's happening elsewhere
		* Way to connect RCs and club captains with each other
		* -AND- way for us to track what's happening
		* Will think about incentives/rewards for people inputting events
		* Google form - feeds database and also inputs to github
	* Do you know how many participants come?
		* Event reporter asks for # of participants
	* What are requirements/expectations for RCs
		* 2-15 hrs/week (ranges based on area, context, phase)
		* recruiting club captains, providing support
	* How do you assess (quality/learning) and onboarding?
		* some built-in assessment during online training
		* feedback - we ask regularly (email and community call)
	* Mmaki - based in university in Cape Town
		* Club Captains are graduates of the Information Systems degree
		* They have autonomy on how they create their clubs - but with the web lit map as an underpinning, and to weave in their existing academic content
	* Ani - based in Pittsburgh
		* Working at the municipal level - working with parks, for instance
	* Andre - based in Rio
		* working towards rewarding shadowing and mentoring - young participants who move through the lessons more quickly, help their peers
		* partner with local university - students get credit for hours spent with the club


STUDY GROUPS

	What
		The Study Group Project at Mozilla is a suite of tools for semi-regular and informal meetups on open source, open science, and open practice for researchers, students, librarians, and academics.
		Currently have 202 study group
	Why
		To give early career researchers a healthy introduction to Open Science practice and give them an opportunity to connect with (and teach their) peers
	Who
		Researchers
		Librarians
		Students
		Academics (mostly)

	How to improve
		Standardize documentation
		Make the online map interactive (https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups)
		Clean up some of the engineering behind the study group workflow, and simplify infrastructure
		Connect with other groups (Clubs + Cohorts)
		Build more communities and develop and Ambassadors network
		Create onboarding/orientation for SG Leads
			aim to launch in sept, and have that be a connection point (get study group leads talking via gitter, calls, etc.)
			create cohorts by onboarding folks 2x/year

Notes:
	* Participants fork a github repo when they start a club
	* Events reported via jackyl (sp?) blog
	* Groups may meet weekly, monthly, quarterly
	* Group sets themes around science/coding 
	* Library of 40 lessons with suggestions in markdown
	* Git can sometimes be a blocker
	* Public Seminar - part of New School Endangered Scholars program - platform for sharing curriculum, projects, sequences - all narrative based
	* Rob themes
		* Getting people to share code within their lab - researchers write computational reports
		* better practices in coding (version control via git), collaboration, tool-sharing
	* How do study groups connect to each other?
		* monthly calls
		* leads interact with each other informally (twitter, social, email)
		* contribute back lessons
	* Mainly at the graduate level - what might be additional incentives (ability to raise small grants, teaching experience, etc.)
		* main motivation is helping on their research projects 



OPEN LEADERSHIP COHORT (OLC)

	What 
		The Open Leadership Cohort (OLC) is a group of about 30 researchers that the Mozilla Science Lab engages in mentorship over a few months leading up to an opportunity that showcases their project/study group/ community work. These folks are inducted via a Working Open Workshop (WOW) and mentored every two weeks via half-hour meetings with MSL and affiliate staff, culminating in their participation in Mozfest/Global Sprint.
		
		Currently have 30 OLC members
	Why
		We wanted a way to content with great candidates  doing awesome work in our community, but outside the fellowship program, we'd also like to groom them as mentors as we build our network.
	Who
		Researchers
		Fellow Applicants (not accepted)
		Study Group Leads
		Project Leads (Collaborate)

	How to improve
		Build materials for post-Global Sprint or event engagement
		Plan ways of fostering mentorship between Cohort 1 and Future Cohorts
		Connect the Cohort 1 with Cohort 2 (Chicago) + Study Groups + Clubs


Cross-opportunities
	* Science - looking at "ambassador program" - RC-type mentoring model (currently Mozilla staff 1:1)
	* Better connect people locally (science study leads with RCs/club captains
		* Regional Coordinators
			* not paid, but grants possibly available to help out
			* not metrics-driven
			* about 2-4 hours a week, time reduces after good establishment
			* fills whole week for some (15 hours a week)
			* regional coordinators have 5-10 clubs
		* Quality over quantity
			* just been revamping onboarding - email strategy with kristina
			* launched training platform
		* Channels
	* Offboarding - checking in with folks when they become inactive - what can we learn about why
		* maybe it's a 6 month group?
		* clubs are difficult to compare because so diverse
		* trying to get to this in Study Groups with the onboarding process
		* shaddow programs + academic hours at universites
	* Engagement for clubs
		* High school engagement in clubs + municipal partnerships (pittsburgh)
	* Sharing resources
		* A system of movement and graduation - lifecycle (mozilla club as a teenager, graduates to study groups)
		* Modifying study group model from research audience to open web language
		* Translation for study groups
	* l10n
		* Andre working on new webapp that may be helpful for translating science content
	* Curriculum template - community generated curriculum/guides
	* Attaching humans to guides
