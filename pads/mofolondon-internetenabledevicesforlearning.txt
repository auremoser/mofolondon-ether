Step 1
	* Download Arduino IDE application (Google it)
Step 2
	* Go to http://hackshop.org
	* Click level 5
	* Start with challenge 5.3

Device
	* Arduino - https://www.arduino.cc/
	* The Photon www.spark.io/start
	* Makey Makey (as entry point and for younger audiences) 
	* 
Device Tips

Online Resources
	* Official: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage
	* SparkFun is awesome, and their Ed director believes in an "open hardware" approach: https://learn.sparkfun.com/
		* Project ideas, tutorials, etc. - compatible with Arduino
	* Wireless Earth Watchdogs blog: http://wirelessearthwatchdawgs.blogspot.co.uk/
		* Hive CHA project, using environmental sensors in a classroom setting - project blog, with code, videos, lessons, etc.
	* In Comic Sans, but plenty of resources/tutorials via https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/ 
	* Adaptable/for younger students - LittleBits are less hackable, but the project themes/ideas in concert with other sensors/etc. may be useful/inspirational: http://littlebits.cc/lessons?type=lesson&sort=recent&page=1&per_page=12#browse
	* Via Make Magazine, Arduino projects: http://makezine.com/category/technology/arduino/
	* Arduino on Git: https://github.com/arduino/
	* How to build your own Arduino board: http://diyhacking.com/make-arduino-board-and-bootload/
	* Flocky Bird (built by Michelle) - https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/flockybird - great for Makey Makey, also uses Thimble to allow people to adjust code to change elements of the game 


Project Ideas
	* LED Thermometer+1
		* Write a program that reads tomorrow's weather forecast
		* Send output from that program to an LED thermometer that glows according to the temperature forecast
		* Advanced: if you can capture physical input (e.g. via a Makey Makey) you could build a touch-sensitive map that allow you to touch the location where you're traveling tomorrow and program the LED to light based on the forecast temperature in that location.
