Shareout
	* Big discoveries?
	* Big blockers?


Cohort name and purpose?

		* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JloT5LpUC1cwpr3klw7z8bHMxH83W33RAOhw0uG5vN4/edit
		* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h3m2Fsgu6c4T6cv99K3HrqFCOG5QeNfgTibEF9IPJts/edit
	* Collecting stories across hubs + Conversation that happened in global group + Hive portfolios
		* Who writes stories?
			* Claw tells staff to write them as blog posts
			* Study group leads
				* 
		* What is a story?
			* A meaty 
			* Mostly meta-data
				* Title
				* URL
				* contact
		* What are the goals?
			* Knowledge of and Insight on what's happening in our programs and network  - successes and challenges [primary] 
				* I said it's sad to think of all the lost stories and artifacts. Claw furthered: we are killing ourselves by not capturing this stuff from our programs in an accessible cross-org way. 
			* Capacity to tell our story more easily and with more impact
			* Reduce sadness +1 [goal #0]
			* Promotion / Recognition [primary/secondary]
			* Inspiring replication [secondary]
			* Helping people find useful stuff [secondary]
			* Connecting ppl to one another [secondary]
			* Inspiring good feelings :) [tertiary]
			* Attracting contributors [tertiary]
			* 
		* Notifications - how do we subscribe to stories?
	* Chat's role as a platform
		* It's missing people
		* participants and conversations are still mostly engineer focused, like in IRC
			* are there non-technical conversations that we're not aware of happening in non-engineering channels?
		* Worried about people adopting it
		* Slack
			* We left IRC because of ostensibly bad UX, but Mattermost isn't great in that department either.
			* A lot of people are using Slack already. We should "go where our users are" and not make them come to us.
			* Slack has an IRC adapter, so you can use it with non-Slack clients.
			* Slack has mobile clients and push notifications.
			* 
		* tl;dr: Slack disabled their ability to invite because they had too many users:
			*  https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html
		* It's difficult to build and deploy on Heroku (not a 12 factor app) and every release seems to break my super hacky custom buildpack.
	* What's happening with the things after this process? (Simon)
