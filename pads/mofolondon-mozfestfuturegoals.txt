Meeting format: Discuss 3 broad questions to inform how MozFest should evolve, be relevant to our strategy, and valuable to our community.


	1) What is the purpose of MozFest? 
Discussion prompts:
	* How do we want to balance sharing Mozilla's work with the community and to listening to what the community has to say?
	* How is the festival's purpose reflected in the location?

Notes: 






2) How can MozFest  become a vehicle for movement building? 
Discussion prompts:
	* How can MozFest be used for leadership development?
	* Would multiple MozFests in different cities grow the movement or dilute it?
	* What would be the benefits and challenges of passing the reigns to community leaders in London, while we try something different in a new location?

Notes: 





3) What is the role of our MozFest partners?
Discussion prompts:
	* How do our current partners (Ravensbourne, BBC r&d, Met Office, Digital Me, EPIK, iRights, and now the Arts Award, Tate and VnA) contribute to the festival's success? 
	* How do we envision partnerships evolving by 2020, if we stay in London and/or if we move to a different city?

Notes:




What are the next steps for continuing this discussion?

Who are the other stakeholders we should include?

Have we made any decisions today that will significantly change the festival in 2017?

The future of MozFest
How can MozFest continue to evolve, be relevant to our strategy and valuable to our community.
Convenings are at the the front of our strategy, and MozFest is our biggest and brightest convening.

Q:What is the broad purpose of MozFest? Is it a chance for us to share our work with the community or to listen to what the community  have to say, ie the sessions they put forward?
If we want to share our work should we be somewhere we are a high value to the audience, have greater chance of spreading our work and ethos- being part of the larger pictures.
If we are using MozFest to listen to the community, what they are working on what they are debating and leveraging through session submissions. We will want to bring as many in as possible and be where they are most active or have the greatest chance of attending in large numbers.


Q:How is MozFest a vehicle for leadership development? Do we take the skeleton of the festival to another country and leave our communities leaders in place to lead in London?
As we think towards 2020 how to we see Mozfest playing that lead role on our convenings calendar as our largest and most public event - is this through one large event in the UK, small mini events around the world moving our partners and our teams or allowing our estabalished partners in the UK take the lead with our gudience and MoFo teams recreate another version of the event elsewhere- ie start again
Do we keep our UK event and creating a new version 2.0 in Asia or South America with new partners


Q Do our partners make our festival and are our asset, tool and resource or are they a vessel to attract new audience to our work? 
Should we be moving to a country where we have access to a larger audience know of our product but are not fully aligned.
Or should we move to where our most vocal audience/community is and use mozfest as a Leadership development tool
Creating smaller subset events, led by us in the MozFest frame but using local content and talent

Attendees:
	* 3 circle of attendees
		* Mozilla
		* Community and partners
		* Registered attendee and  invited guests- those who we want to work with, those who know what we do but dont necessarily agree with our work or align (yet ) with our work. This is always the largest group of new audience- this for me is our highest value


The venue

	* We stay in the UK not for our love of the city but for the love of the venue.
	* Its open, bright, well equipt, supportive. It is the epithonie of open, you can see all the floors, the heart of the festival.
	* We have embedded ourselves into their curriculum, their narrative, their academic program. 
	* We use their pool of student talent over the weekend from fire wardens, to rigging team, to graphic design team.
	* We have hired past students in contract postitions for roles within the production team, Marc Walsh and Dosed.
	* We mentor their events team, assist in leadership development
	* We already have an acedemic scholarhship and we are potentially about to enter into a larger post graduate partnership

The local partnerships-
BBC r&d, Met office, digital Me, EPIK, irights, and now the Arts Award, Tate and VnA



The cost
The are expanding at a fast rate and the cost of accommodating gets higher
Cost of good is increasing, contracters are expensive.
This is the 6th year in London, do we need to refresh!


Who are our stakeholders
As we take next steps who else should be involved in this conversation?


Wild card
Move next year but in 2018 move a portion of the event into more festival vibe, camping, summer, tents, fields, generators, music at night, sessions and talks during the day.
