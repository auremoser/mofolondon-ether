special guest appearance: Mark Surman

Problem statement: Still really hard for people to understand WTF MozFest is.

To Do: Use marketing to help people understand why they want to come. 

Kristie’s story:
1 - MozFest got on her radar
2 - at first she was skeptical. WTF is this and why should I care?
3 - interested
4 - high level participation

^ how do we recreate that journey for others?
^ test that hypothosis

Language:
	* Our current language is self-referential and generic. “A community of people” could apply to the NRA. Get rid of the language that doesn’t say much.
	* Don’t need to skew the language too far into movement-building. Won’t appeal to the entire MozFest audience, especially if they've never been.
	* Experience brand of MozFest while you’re there is really strong. But how do we attract new people?
	* Look at other conferences that have weird, arcane content. How do they market their events.


MozFest website:
	* Language feels old and stale. Need to stop re-using it.
	* Does the MozFest site become a respository for the outputs from the event?

Plan of Action:
1) Work Mark's thoughts into V2 of the speech bubble/messaging brief
2) Once that's got Mark's signoff, work it into the comms plan template
3) Comms plan will identify how we want to reach out to people
4) In parallel, reach out to space wranglers to find the list of people we want to reach out to
5) Roll this all back together into a comms
