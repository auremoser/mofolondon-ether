How community can get involved (and stay involved):

	*  MozFest:
			* Promotion
			* Selection of sessions
			* ID pathways
			* WOW / Leadership Training + Testing at MozFest
			* Running sessions
	* Study Group 
		* Test out an in-person regional onboarding
	* Continue to offer immersive events 
	* Presence at conferences / swag
		* having a staff member there helps add credibility (along with community members)
		* anna: try it out for a year with 2-3 events 
	* Need to have a way of providing access beyond smaller, invited events
	* Maybe targeting labs / educators / PIs / librarians

How are we measuring progress:

	* Size
		* # of participants across events
		* Project Leads
		* Study Group Leads
		* Fellows

	* Connectivity - looking at strength of connections // 
		*  who else others engage with in the network
		*  how do you collaborate with those folks? (collaborator -> general acquaintance)

	* Retention
		* Sustaining momentum and engagement
		* Levelling up / providing opportunities for participants to get actively involved. 

NOTES:

	* are there ways to, through personalized engagement and shorter calls (rather than flying a big group to one location) to help inject shared values, support, etc?
	* rob: got involved because he was interested in it, was on the calls, joined the sprint. 
		* image for open science at Mozilla - how different is that vs how others are approaching open science? 
		* 


Questions:
	*  Who are "members"?
		* People who see a connection to Mozilla, and actively participating in Mozilla efforts.
		* How to turn up the dial so that others feel ownership of this work / part of the movement? 

		*  Are you identifying with the work itself or the organization.?
			* Get to shared value first (versus Mozilla Mozilla ra-ra / framing materials about contributing solely to Mozilla)

		* What are the smaller ways that people can get more engaged in the community (knowing we can't bring everyone to London)

    
 Soundbytes:
	* Rob: "I didn't feel disconnected before, but now I feel more a part of it and ownership of this." <3   
	* Anna: think about conferences as distribution points
