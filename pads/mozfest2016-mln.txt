Call for Proposals
Who are we inviting? 
How are we inviting?
What's our #MIMI plan?
Questions:
	* I’ve had a question about if it's web literacy - does it really include me? how does teaching/learning related to IoT, robotics, physical computing, fill-in-the-blank tech relate to our space?

GitHub Repo
https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2016
	How to use: 
		* Issues are submissions
		* Top comment is the official submission and should never be edited!
		* Labels will be space specific & searchable. 
		* Facilitators (submitters) will provide their first and second choice for what space they feel their session is most appropriate for. 
		* Later we will use the labels to help identify pathways.
		* June/July is the time to read the submissions. 
		* August is the time for curation.

	Etiqutte:
		* Facilitators will get an e-mail confirmation that their submission is available and public on GitHub.
		* We need to be mindful that any comments we write are public and available to facilitator

	New to Github? 
		* Github intro lesson with Erika - June 29th 08:00PST//11:00 ET//16:00 BST
		* Written tutorial - last year’s @ https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-program. They are working to update and I will update this link when it’s done.
		* Share your Github handle with Erika to get admin privileges

Open Badges
Need to think about open badges (https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozfest) - how do we want to incorporate? through particular sessions? through a pathway? through an experience in our space? Contact is Matt Rogers (matt.rogers@digitalme.co.uk, @mattdigitalme).
		* Robert to chat Marina about this

Closing Takeaways
	Takeaways: What is something you're leaving this call having gained (answers or questions)?
		* Clearer to-do's relating to the next process of picking sessions and a way to support those that are submitting sessions. Lot's of really cool ideas - very exciting.
		* Lots of understanding/information, lots of support, lots of great ideas, 
		* So much going on! I'm blown away by the activity: my key takeaway is that I feel much less in the drivers seat and much more on the bandwagon with you all now. So glad to see ownership and leadership developing... obviously this comes as we achieve greater clarity of purpose. I never expected any less from you all :) thanks for making my job easy :D
		* Feeling ever more prepared to make the "ask"

	Gratitude: What's something you appreciated from this group or an individual?
		* So much awesome progress being made already - thanks!!! 
		* Patience and the ongoing opportunities for acquisition of new skills 
		* Progress. Good to be a part of something that's moving forward fueled by lots of work and contributions from the team.
		* I'm grateful for your trust in stewarding this work and understanding as a juggle a number of personal/professional transitions.

	Celebration: What are you excited about right now? OR What's got you down?
		* Half Term yay! Spending time with family.  A great cool 8x8x8 LED cube that I've seen and will be supporting the maker with.  Got me down, misunderstandings and assumptions had some of that this week too:(

		* Making sure everyone is feeling "in the loop" with progress & next steps
		* continued direction, an idea of where invitations to proposals might slot into our vision (the call was very heavy on web... which is right and good, but I wonder if there is room for additions that encourage learning about computing and coding in general and just exciting tech?

		* 
	Team Norming: What is something you hope to give the team today? What is something the team should consider?

Notes:
	* Hall of Mirrors reminds me of the video going around about the man imprisoned for DUI beaming into the mirrors at men's rooms in bars. But we'd be lighter.
		* Reflective experiences/gallery walk
		* Fun house > fear house
	* The entry way needs to capture the spirit, but delimit traffic or be the only way into the space, right?
	* Question: Is the carnival/fun-house metaphor festival-wide or specific to this space?
		* The idea of showing people a haunted house and then taking them behind the scenes is great.
	* Potential things to connect/resurface:
		* Gaming space
		* A "room" people can control w/ IoT +1
			* We could cue some user controlled signage like the "panic inc sign"" https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/
		* Team Rogue stuff
	* It would be a good challenge for staff and allies to prepare rigorously to be "buskers" that are like mobile Ignite talks.
		* Can Luke & co. write webby songs and perform?
		* Place for music/music making w/ tech on the floor?
	* Opportunity for BreakoutEdu-like experience w/ open IoT or a walled garden themed breakout room? Do we have web artists who could install?
	* I saw a project once that printed "fortunes" based on tweets - thinking "Big" Zoltar +1 this is hilariously awesome. +1 we need this!!! anyone has a termal printer we could use?
		* This + a tweetbot workshop = return to connecting educators, new learners w/ developers doing weird, personal, human things in this space
	* I love the idea of a "ride" - "welcome to the internet, I will be your guide" needs to be present.+1, this is great.
	* Sounds fun = think it'll be in how we balance the theme with being not too-theme-y
//

Walk-through:
	* Entrance: Programmable signage
		* Live-coded marquee
		* improved littleBits signs?
		* Barker w/ scheduling materials in lieu of scheduling poster
		* Virtual tickets (can they sign up so we text people before a session they want to join begins?)
	* Pass through hall of mirrors (also opp to reconnect audience w/ web art, human touch)
		* space for wanderlust engagement
		* Lightbeam interaction
		* ascii art generator
	* Open space
		* hack jam space
		* programming space
		* sit down next to workers and ask questions, contribute, hand-off projects, improv learning
	* Session spaces branch off of open space
		* how many spaces?
			* make'em w/ dividers?
		* what kinds of proposals?
			* could be for sessions
			* could be for labs
			* could be for galleries
			* could be for arcades
		* documentation station
			* localize with us?
				* document in your own language idea
			* create a response and tweet it
	* Questions
		* Connections - will there be an IoT space? Will connected devices be spread out and in the science fair instead?
			* IoT everywhere - it's gone mainstream -
			* What's the anti-space group up to?
		* Linking to youth zone - one of the things I loved last year was most/best integration of young people throughout mozFest to date
	* Questions from Chad, FWTW. Disregard and move ahead as appropriate.
		* Agree w/ Andre re: comms, but also worry about the event itself - web literacy is for all; mentorship, service, and community projects connect to what we do, as well, and to emergent open leadership curriculum, FWIW. not clear on what the worry is
			* Is time spent convincing people that they can teach/they are teachers better than time spent on web lit is for all and you can share it, broadly?
		* Is there a metaphor that does more of what we want and less of what we don't want? (i.e. competing w/ YouthZone)
			* e.g. mentor fair
		* Is there some unpacking to do about YouthZone based on last year?
		* Are we learning, leadership, or web literacy space? Those inflections impact how I think about the space.

Outreach
	* Videos: 
		* Let's also use this if/when we can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTxPRi_LDOk 
	* should we push hard in/around London?
	*

Thoughts from Chad
Last year because of the number of sessions that created some divisions between our pedagogical and technical (developer) sides in learning.
Aurelia was doing subjective mapping with CartoDB – this was missed by people because it wasn't in the open
How do we "close the loop" between membership in our learning community and those few people who build the next generation of open on the Web

			* bank holiday monday! I need some family time :) seriously.
			* getting pretty jazzed about Berlin on the horizon. I haven't been there before, and I hear it's super cool, but I'm always sad to leave home behind. So a bittersweet celebration ;) yeah, we are also leaving 18 year old son behind to fend for himself - yikes!!!Brave!

			* Something we can all collaborate on - coz I like collaboration :)+1+1

			* As above. Frank had some interesting insights and is not far from what I observed at MozFest last year.

STUFF from other places...

		* YOUR INPUT: What's Our (Learning Team) Purpose?
			* What's the statement we want to make about our work to people who join us at MozFest? How do you interpret our unique value-add at Mozilla. Say it In as few characters as possible. The most succinct but complete and accurate statement wins! The prize is my admiration and deep respect ;)
				* Hands on, participatory contribution and learning that equate building an open and inclusive web with building open and inclusive community
					* Inclusion, Contribution, Revolution +1+1
					* A collaborative, inclusive and innovative space to advance the open web revolution.
				* To unlock agency and expand opportunities through our hands-on participatory awesome events and content
				* To advance the promise of the Internet for learning (stolen from Building Networks Team convo planned for later today; Hivey)
					* Love this one!+1+1
				* A network that makes together, learns together.
				* Advancing the promise of the web for learning (oops, Sam, we stole from same place.)
				* Connecting people to projects, opportunities and other people to advance web literacy while making an impact in their communities 
				* rallying communities to shape the agenda, create impact, and future cast technology for learning 

		* Your Input: What do you want to see MORE of in the MLN Mozilla Learning (< thank you) Space at MozFest this year?
			* More interactive learning aka learning from each other through engaging activities (less session-based) +1
			* More free time to network and meet everyone. +1+1+1+1+1
			* Loved the Global Village space last year - would love to see our space embody all the places people learn (museum area with Tate Modern activities, library, classroom, community space, home, etc.)   +1+1
				* Hmmmm, this is intriguing. I don't wanna rip off the global village, but we could totally do a museum, library, community center, science center... maybe there is a way to do this via pathways and across other spaces... brain juices flowing :)
			* Customizable space <- can you say more about this? Sounds intriguing.thinking bean bags, boxes, lighting, just to make corners and chats more comfortable and unique. I loved the "quiet space" from a couple years ago...also, just want a reason to build forts - ah, like a modular DIY space. love it. also love forts. +1 for fortsyes! modular DIY ;)
			* Live Mozilla Curriculum Workshop recording with participants that are attending <-- this needs to happen! +1 +1 also talked to Bobby, think a pop-up podcast zone for all MozFest would be put to good use LOVE PODCASTS <3 <3 <3+1
			* IoT, connected home goodness, I want our space to feel even more like "Teh Future"
			* Early release of call for session proposals +1
				* I'd like to do this via the community wranglers... even if proposal calls get delayed, people should be ready to hit submit on day 1 because we've prepped them and spread the word.
			* More local educators and youth jumping in and out of the space - take advantage of the community we've gathered locally and engage them! ( I like how Su's making station did this last year)I can make introductions with key partners here in London and the UK- would be awesome to plug them in earlier to spaces so they feel more involved

==========================================================================
Check-in w/ Kim & Robert on 4/18

Questions:
	* Who has traditionally been the target audience for MozFest? For MLN? For participants? For facilitators?
		* this is a good question without a simple answer (as always). OK, the simple answer: 
			* For MozFest in general: advocates for the open web.
			* For MLN: mostly our friends and community members; educators using or co-creating Mozilla resources, who have traditionally been out-of-school time or informal educators and these days are club captains; Some (small) number of random walk-ins or local formal educators; 
		* Who are we trying to reach this year AND who *can* we reach?
			* Non-local, non-Mozilla folks tend to have stipends: they submit a good proposal, they're accepted, we stipend their travel OR they're already close friends we know we want to be there;
			* unpack what reach looks like:
				* local vs. remote – bring people in live without having to be there
				* direct vs. indirect – does activity at MozFest extend beyond MozFest (train the trainer, design for audiences)
					* our direct audience doesn't have to be our target audience
					* our focus could be "reach the most learners possible"

	* Who has shown up in the past? Do we have demographic info? Do we know why they show up? What they love & what they want to see improved?
		* Not great data on this. Mostly it's folks who either a) can afford a ticket to London, b) are sent there on Mozilla funds, or c) are Europeans, namely Brits. There's an incredible diversity for a tech gathering, but a more modest one for what you might expect from a global gathering;

	* What new experiences, backgrounds, ideas, thoughts do we want to see represented at MozFest? What are their barriers for entry?
		* This is a great question, it's exactly the sort of thing that I can take to our team for some input!

	* What does DARCI mean?
		* It's a decision/responsibility matrix adapted from RACI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix
		* We add D for Decider in order to make power dynamics transparent. The Decider has ultimate oversight;
		* You can see a drafty DARCI below for this work;
				* Decider: TBD
				* Accountable: Robert (w/ support from Kim)
				* Responsible: Community Wranglers
					* Kim
					* Su
					* Simeon
				* Consulted/Helping:
					* Amira Dhalla
					* Julia Vallera
					* Chad Sansing
					* Andre Garzia
					* Simona Ramkisson
					* Lainie DeCoursy
				* Learning:
					* 
				* Informed: 
					* Learning Team
					* Learning Community

	* So many cool ideas are being shared/incubated during the teachtheweb curriculum workshops. How can we facilitate their next steps?
		* This is exactly on point. That's what we'll want to do over the next 2-3 months. Create a space that invites folks participation and motivate them to show up!

TODOs for Friday 22 call
	* Kim: Follow-up with Chad about us doing a curriculum workshop on preparing a proposal for MozFest 
	* Robert : get a list of all the Mozilla Learning Activities.
		* working on this... got some information, need to compile
	* Robert: Try to get some feedback from the MozFest crew on demographics of attendees (where do they come from);
		* They don't collect this information!!! We've got nothing to answer this question with.
		* Trying to get a sense of what % of attendees were funded by Mozilla to attend.



==========================================================================
Staff Crew Check-in on 4/12

Agenda
	* (15 min) Let's get it all out there!
	* (5 min) Robert's Approach
	* (10 min) Timeline & Logistics
	* (15 min) What's missing
	* (5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude


(15 min) Let's get it all out there!
What brings you to the call this morning? What's your MozFest passion? 
If a MadLib helps here, let's go with: I'm joining this crew to make sure __________________ is represented and/or we don't let _________________ happen again.
	* Andre: I'm joining this crew to make sure fun and creativity +1 are represented in all our actions
		* too many sessions crammed into a short time!
		* my favorite mozFest thing is EXPLORING! I love to wander around and be surprised by stuff.  I wish this could be facilitated.
	* Julia: I am joining to make sure we build new relationships/friendships through simple FUN +1 so we don't exhaust people again. (been exausted there before, know the feeling)+1
	* Simona: I'm joining to make sure to make sure is that we grow and better embed the inclusion and diversity piece is represented in more than one dedicated space and that we see it anchored in core programming i.e speakers, spaces and sessions +1+1 +1
		* quality of sessions was affected by...
		* making sure that people feel like this is a place to come back and work again
		* Working with speakers and session leaders – logistics and facilitation are not completely removed from each other +1
	* Chad: I'm joining to make sure we create inclusive, welcoming spaces for playing, making, and learning outside sessions and other more formal spaces; I'd like to make sure we don't lose large, widely differentiate-able spaces for hackery. +1 (2016 is the year of the sandwich printer) YAH.
		* The part that blew my mind as a first-time participant was having the time and agency to choose which worthwhile thing to do in depth over the whole weekend in community - there was nothing like that in traditional NA public education for me until I could bring some back. <3
	* Robert: I'm gonna add my two cents below ;) +1 to everything above!
	* 

Do you have an idea(s) or things in the works that we should definitely know about?
	* See Amira's TEAM ROGUE LEARNING notes below or in this pad: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfestteamrogue (feel free to add notes or ideas!) <3 <3 <3 this pad, so many good ideas!!! plusses+1
	* I would like to see an incubator/hacker/maker space. <-- I want this too! 
	* I would like to see some sessions become a combined ignite sessions to "zip" the amount of content in a fun, rigorous way for folks who enjoy such talking events.
	* It would be great to have a space session that kicks off Mozfest similar what AMC did on teaching people to be good listeners, supportive 
		* Seconded :) 
		* third - music/movement is good to warm up
	* Can we have MLN Picnic?
		* Bring your own sandwich supplies, put them into the Run, Sandwich, Run! arrays, and eat what you generate. I have some tomato and lettuce toners here... :)+1
	* I would like designated time for reflection at the end - it was very helpful to do this with our Diverse leaders folks last year
	* Web Literacy Leaders - this program (developed by An-Me and Chad/me) and its first cohort will likely launch ahead of MozFest. We would like MozFest to be an opportunity for them to have a F2F gathering and some responsibility for sharing the OER they develop or facilitating/sprinting on related work.

Flags
	* Youth Zone – when they ran out of room they annexed the MLN space in a way that was disruptive
	* There is a tension between giving wranglers and "pathfinders" agency in organizing the work and then relatively late-appearing instructions from the event team.

(5 min) Robert's Approach
Robert shares what he'd like to make sure that we lead with...
	* Doing less means compromising more (appreciate the difficulty here)
	* We let our community space wrangler lead and make decisions that are informed by our deep knowledge of this space, but driven by them
	* 

	* Questions
		* What are the mechanisms to make sure the team is informed?
			* let's deep dive on that below here, but basic piece is that Robert is the go-between and we can create new spaces for doing that too, but their not 
		* Can we make a DARCI for this?
			* YES! Good call:
				* Decider: ??? Not 100% Sure but guessing Sarah?
				* Accountable: Robert
				* Responsible: Community Wranglers
				* Consulted: MLN Staff MozFest Crew
				* Informed: Whole MLN Team
			* Deadlines, clear accountability and expectations are key 
				* Strong suggestion is to reverse engineer a schedule from last year w/ best guess deadlines and mentor texts shared ASAP.
					* thanks Chad, this is great.
			* We are using a variation of DARCI here in Rio which might be a good idea for MozFest with the following roles:
					* One person responsible < this is what we call accountable and I would stick to that language
					* Any number of people consulted/helping < I would call "helping" as responsible
					* Any number of people as LEARNERS/apprentices on that task < I like this... need to think about it a little bit, but the spirit is great maybe also "shadowing"
				* So with this system we usually have 1 responsible person, 2 people being consulted and helping and 1 or 2 apprentices learning about that type of task.


(10 min) Timeline & Logistics
	* April – solicit staff and community member input that can inform our Purpose Statement at the Berlin MozFest retreat
		* Robert to use weekly MLN staff calls to get staff input
		* Wranglers to use regional coordinator calls, club captain emails, Hive calls, community calls, curriculum calls, etc. to solicit input
	* May – Berlin retreat: nail down space logistics and determine a Purpose Statement for the Mozilla Learning space at MozFest
		* Before we as a team begin to really plan out the logistics for things like what's in Amira's pad we should invite our community to respond to us.
			* Time is a major blocker here;
			* Can we create a hybrid? Where we are prepared but also accommodate folks;
		* Socialize this out with our staff and communities ASAP to get their interpretations
		* Suggestion: Have a timeline and mentor texts for the first task coming out of the retreat.
			* what do you mean by "mentor text" 
				* "Here is what you should comment on GH to 'claim' a session." "Here is an acceptance email." "Here is an email extending a travel stipend." "Here is a Google Form you can send to get passport and travel information from stipended presenters."
		* Suggestion: Try to establish an expectation of how much time there will be from each ask until its task is due (say 2 weeks or whatever) and commit to having mentor texts/resources/calls schedules ready to go out with each ask.
		* Suggestion: Begin office hours for community space wranglers. Maybe rotate as staff helpers. Every two weeks starting in May; we each do two w/ Robert or an event team member?
		* Suggestion: Prep and practice with a dummy repo if we're using GH again and share processes for articulating the differences between labels and milestones and resolving conflicts between groups that want the same session.
		* Suggestion: Community Wranglers Podcast. Get them all talking about the experience, share their stories! Boom.
		* Suggestion: badges? Recognize all their efforts...
	* June – Request for proposals opens! 
		* Use community calls and spaces to motivate proposals
	* July
		* Suggestion: do something in July so as not to lose momentum; maybe work with space wranglers to develop kick-off events modeled after inclusion work? Participation guide for Mozfest?+1
	* August – Start proposal review
	* September – Send acceptances < i wish this could happen sooner +1+!+1(also if it comes to if funding is involved) OK, I'll try to get a better assessment of this so we can feel reassured or anticipate this as a major blocker.
			* Volunteers/Mozilla Community goes crazy with anxiety waiting for acceptance letters  (or maybe it was just me) yap.


(15 min) What's missing
What is missing from the plan above? What/who should we include in this plan?
	* July.
	* Roadmap for community wranglers so they never feel lost.
	* Inclusion deep-dive in session evaluation, selection, and planning  -  from Simona. +1 from Chad.
	* Answer me this: How do we ensure that we are doing our utmost best to deliver quality programming - from Simona. +1 from Chad.
	* Time and space for co-designing the kinds of spaces and events we'd like BEFORE the last three weeks before MozFest - from Julia. +1 from Chad +1+1
	* Can we sync the topics for the curriculum workshop events with the areas inside the MLN space so that our calls pave the way to mozFest? 
		* Kinda sorta - we try to follow the MLN editorial calendar, but we also break ranks sometimes to support specific projects with time-constrained needs; so....definitely for a summer episode, but maybe not for all 3 summer episodes? Definitely for October? Thats good! If we have just a number of calls in sync that already shows movement towards mozFest which is the whole idea. :D
		* We can start spinning this up w/ planning for calls after May, which is set on youth civic engagement.


(5 min) Closing: Key Takeaways and Gratitude
How to stay connected? How do you want to be involved?
	* Staying connected beyond calls: Can we have a space on the mattermost/chat.mozillafoundation.org thing? It would allow for cool async comms and also for informal chats!+1
	* Keep this group as the consulted staff team – bi-weekly meetings

What is your takeaway from this call? What is the single most important thing you are leaving with or excited about? How would you like to remain included?
	* Excited to have more time to plan and that we will have three community members to build this with
	* Structuring the process ahead of time, but not the product, shows both care for our wranglers and trust in them.
	* Definitely big +1 on the start time this year 
	* I loved all the fresh ideas and how mozFest will be always kept on the bleeding edge of awesomeness thanks to you folks.
	* 

Kudos, thanks, acknowledgements, positive reinforcements, things to work on next, constructive feedback:
	* To Robert for all the awesome work
	* Major love to this team! 
	* Robert le Robert - wrangle on! This is a great team to be a part of - thoughtfulness and compassion abound with deep expertise.'Ca
	* 
	* Thank you all for your deep knowledge and commitment to making this awesome! Keep the feedback coming.

	* Engaging staff to vision what they think is cool and fun
	* Having sessions that respond to the theme, but having areas that really produce experiences
	* We have SO MANY, WAY TOO MANY sessions in our space and staff never get to go and attend other sessions
	* For staff (and maybe anyone) we're focused on aspects where we can dip in and out
	* A three-day long experience may be the wrong level of commitment
	* A place where people can discuss challenges and opportunities will work for some folks
	* A good example of a good experience:
		* David Ascher think at Orlando
		* A teach the web relay-race – something like the science sprint or Laura Hillger's science sprint
		* or a weekend-long skill-share handoff – sit down, learn a skill, hand it off to the next person before they leave

On getting broad community input
	* If we're getting community input, we need to set some clear boundaries and manage expectations about how input will be used
	* Simeon or others can definitely take 5 minutes and then there's a monthly email that goes to all coordinators and club captains – Amira is definitely the best POC
